Updated to Minecraft 1.21.2

- Fixed Dynmap Compatibility not creating any markers
- Fixed cooldown showing twice on inventory button tooltip
- Fixed blurred background rendering on edit screen even though it's not consistent with Vanilla
- Through that, should circumvent an issue where the waystone edit screen does not show up with certain other mods installed
